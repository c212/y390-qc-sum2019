**************problems i've faced in the notes and book****************

PROBLEM: Notes don't explicitly say to install jupyter (it's the title though!)
SOLUTION: pip3 install jupyter

PROBLEM: Qiskit 0.7(or 8 ?).0 was installed, links to old API. Link in exception redirects to new API--impossible to accept license in link. Exception reproduced:
ConnectionError: Couldn't connect to IBMQ server: error during login: License required. You need to accept the License from Web Platform. https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net
SOLUTION: Updated Qiskit in the usual fashion (pip3 install qiskit -U) and added 2nd parameter, URL, to both methods. URL can be found under 'Your accounts' near the bottom of the page. Corrected block in its entirety:

from qiskit import IBMQ
# Authenticate an account and add for use during this session. Replace string argument with your private token.
IBMQ.enable_account('MY_API_TOKEN', 'MY_URL')
# To store your credentials locally you can run:
#IBMQ.save_account('MY_API_TOKEN', 'MY_URL')
#source: https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html#install-access-ibm-q-devices-label

PROBLEM: Chapter1 Ex. 3 instructs to "change the backend to an option beginning with ibmq_5 and then Run". None begins with 'ibmq_5_', and besides 'ibmq_qasm_simulator', all backends I have available in IBMQ.backends() are not simulators. Here's my list:
[<IBMQSimulator('ibmq_qasm_simulator') from IBMQ(ibm-q, open, main)>, <IBMQBackend('ibmqx4') from IBMQ(ibm-q, open, main)>, <IBMQBackend('ibmqx2') from IBMQ(ibm-q, open, main)>, <IBMQBackend('ibmq_16_melbourne') from IBMQ(ibm-q, open, main)>]
SOLUTION: use one of the other IBMQ backends



PINION: The math underlying the Kronecker tensor product should be introduced in chapter 3 when preparing states. It’s intuitive and helps build an intuition for the exponentiation that motivates quantum computing in the first place.


PROBLEM: Ch 8, 4th code listing in notebook: module ‘qiskit’ has no attribute ‘wrapper’
SOLUTION: use the following:

print(dir(qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit))
qc = qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str(qasm_str)

Source: https://qiskit.org/documentation/_modules/qiskit/circuit/quantumcircuit.html#QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str


PROBLEM: Ch 8 p128: Qiskit Aqua installation and testing code does not work. pip command returned “Requirement already satisfied” for both
SOLUTION: use the following:

pip3 install qiskit-aqua qiskit-chemistry

# Testing QISKit Aqua installation
import qiskit.aqua
import qiskit.chemistry


PROBLEM: Ch 8 notebook: (How to play sound over ssh?) error: No available audio device 
ALSA lib confmisc.c:767:(parse_card) cannot find card '0'
ALSA lib conf.c:4555:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_card_driver returned error: No such file or directory
ALSA lib confmisc.c:392:(snd_func_concat) error evaluating strings
ALSA lib conf.c:4555:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_concat returned error: No such file or directory
ALSA lib confmisc.c:1246:(snd_func_refer) error evaluating name
ALSA lib conf.c:4555:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_refer returned error: No such file or directory
ALSA lib conf.c:5034:(snd_config_expand) Evaluate error: No such file or directory
ALSA lib pcm.c:2565:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM default
SOLUTION: 


Problem: subject verb agreement
“The document checker now suspects there is no possible combination of
documents that are valid,”
SOLUTION: “there is no possible combination…that is valid”


PROBLEM: Typo Ch 9 p150, Quantum OR gate: “That is to say, our reversible AND
gate will map input bit a to output bit a',”
SOLUTION: replace “AND” with “OR”

PROBLEM: Typo Ch 9 p 151: “First, we must just negate each of the three input qubit”
SOLUTION: replace “qubit” w/ “qubits”

PROBLEM: Comma abuse Ch 9 p152: “The first, outputs to a qubit which serves as one of the input qubits to the second part:”
SOLUTION: remove the comma between subject and verb

PROBLEM: Comma abuse Ch 10 p164 (the final comma) “To increase the
probability enough so that it is likely in just one measurement to get the correct input that
satisfies the checker, we will in general need to run the checker function and then
the mover function steps multiple times, until the chance that we get the correct input when we measure, is very high.”
SOLUTION: remove comma
